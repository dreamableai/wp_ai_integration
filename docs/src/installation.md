## Server requirements

Algolia Search plugin for WordPress has a few system requirements to be able to work properly.

You will need to make sure your server meets the following requirements:

- PHP >= 5.3
- cURL PHP extension
- mbstring PHP extension
- `/wp-admin` part of the website should not be protected behind an .htaccess password as this won't allow the queue to handle tasks
- OpenSSL greater than 1.0.1
- WordPress in version 3.7.x

<div class="alert alert-warning">You will not be able to install the plugin if one of this requirement is not met.</div>
